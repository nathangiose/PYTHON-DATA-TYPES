# So this is the second python file
# In ths file we'll be accessing values in a list
# So lets start by creating 2 lists,
# Then print the two lists


list1 = ['Math', 'Math-lit', 2020, 2021]
list2 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
print(list1)
print(list2)
print("")
# Next we'll print out or values using the 'Slicing' method
# Slicing uses the same brackets used to create lists
# Let's call out Math Lit 2020 from list 1
# And we can summon numbers 3-to-6
# In line 20, you'll notice something fishy about the numbers put in, query your tutor.


print(list1[1:3])
print(list2[2:5])
print("")

print("Good luck!")
